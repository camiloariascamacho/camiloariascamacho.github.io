## Research Assistants
I am always looking for motivated research assistants and teaching assistants. If you are interested in working with me, please take a minute and read what I'm looking for.

### Minimal Requirements

Here is the list of minimal requirements that you need to be familiar with to work with me:

- Read [Code and Data for the Social Sciences: A Practitioner's Guide](https://web.stanford.edu/%7Egentzkow/research/CodeAndData.pdf) by Gentzkow and Shapiro

- `Git`: You need git knowledge 
- `R`, you need excellent skills with `R`. A good resource is to work through [Hadley's Book](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/index.html), especially chapters 4, 5, 9, and 13. I may ask you for the solutions to these exercises
    - I work a lot with spatial data. Make sure that you are comfortable with it or willing to learn
- `Stata`, you also need excellent skills with `Stata`        
- Good `Python` skills are an asset but not a substitute for `R`.
- Some cases, I may require the use of `Matlab`
- Good `Latex` skills, `Markdown` is a plus but not a substitute
- [Quire](https://quire.io) as management system 
- `UNIX` shell: You need some basic UNIX knowledge
