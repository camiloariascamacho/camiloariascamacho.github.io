### Research in  Progress

* **Do More Eyes on the Street Reduce Crime? Evidence from Chicago’s Safe Passage Program** *(Joint with Ruchi Singh and Dan McMillen)*

	**Abstract**:
    Several studies suggest that “hot spot” and “proactive” policing – i.e., increased deployment of police or private citizens in areas with high crime rates – are effective at reducing crime. However, most of these studies analyze short term exogenous changes in the deployment of police following a terror attack, short term “crackdowns”, or randomized experiments. In this paper, we analyze the effect of adding guards near schools on crime rates over a sustained period of time. The focus of the study is the Safe Passage program, which was implemented in Chicago to increase the safety of children traveling to and from school. We use difference-in-difference and matching techniques to examine the effectiveness of the Safe Passage program in reducing crime. Using crime data from January 2006 to August 2016 and the location of Safe Passage routes, we analyze crime within small geographic units of one eighth by one eighth of a mile. We find strong evidence of the effectiveness of the program, with violent crimes declining by around 14%. However, we do not find a significant decline in property crime. Additionally, our results indicate that the program does not lead to significant spatial spillovers to neighboring unguarded areas. We also find that the program has a positive effect on attendance rates: the presence of a safe passage route is estimated to reduce the rate of absenteeism by about 1.1 percentage points.
