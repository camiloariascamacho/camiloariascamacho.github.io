### Research in  Progress

* **Do More Eyes on the Street Reduce Crime? Evidence from Chicago’s Safe Passage Program [[pdf] (Submitted)](/assets/Safe_Passage_WP.pdf)**
	*(Joint with [Ruchi Singh](http://www.ruchisingh.net/) and [Dan McMillen](https://sites.google.com/site/danielpmcmillen/home))*

	**Abstract**:
    Chicago’s Safe Passage program attempts to ensure the safety of student traveling to and from schools by placing civilian guards along specified routes.  The program was launched during the 2009-2010 school year and now serves 140 schools.  We use data from more than 10 years of geocoded Chicago police reports and school level data to analyze the effects of the Safe Passage program on crime rates and the rate of absenteeism from schools.  Our findings suggest that the program is an efficient and cost effective alternative way of policing with direct effects on crime and student’s outcomes.  Exploiting both spatial and temporal variation in the implementation of the program, we find that the presence of guards result in lower levels of crime, with violent crime declining by 14% on average.  The rate of absenteeism is estimated to decline by 1.1 percentage points. We find no evidence of spillovers of crime to areas that are not along the Safe Passage routes.


* **Gambling and Crime: Evidence from Chicago’s Video Gaming Prohibition) [[SSRN]](https://ssrn.com/abstract=3020332)**

	**Abstract**:
	We study the effect of a large increase in access to gambling on crime by exploiting the expansion of video gambling terminals in Illinois since 2012. Even though video gambling was legalized by the State of Illinois, local municipalities were left with the decision whether to allow it within their jurisdiction. The City of Chicago does not allow video gambling, while many adjacent jurisdictions do. We take advantage of this setting along with detailed incident level data on crime for Chicago to examine the effect of access to gambling on crime. We use a difference-in-differences strategy that compares crime in areas that are closer to video gambling establishments with those that are further away along with the timing of video gambling adoption. We find that (i) access to gambling increases violent and property crimes; (ii) these are new crimes rather than displaced incidents; and (iii) the effects seem to be persistent in time.
