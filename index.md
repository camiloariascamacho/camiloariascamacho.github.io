I'm an Assistant Profesor at the [Economics Department at Universidad de los Andes](https://economia.uniandes.edu.co/). I previously was a Postdoctoral Research Associate in Data Science in Applied Microeconomics at the [National Center for Supercomputing Applications](http://www.ncsa.illinois.edu/).

My primary interests are in Public, Urban, and Real Estate Economics. I'm also interested in Applied Econometrics, Big Data, and Machine Learning.
