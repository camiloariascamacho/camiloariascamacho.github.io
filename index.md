I'm a Postdoctoral Research Associate in Data Science in Applied Microeconomics at the [National Center for Supercomputing Applications](http://www.ncsa.illinois.edu/).

My primary interests are in Public, Urban, and Real Estate Economics. I'm also interested in Applied Econometrics, Big Data, and Machine Learning.


I will be on the job market in 2019-2020 and available for interviews at the EEA 2019 European Job Market in Rotterdam and at the 2020 ASSA Meetings in San Diego.
